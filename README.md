## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of React and state management, especially for handling dynamic user interactions like adding items to the cart and updating the cart totals. Additionally, this is my first time using Tailwind CSS, and I enjoyed how quickly it allowed me to style the app responsively. One of the key takeaways was learning how to efficiently handle conditional rendering based on user actions, like displaying the order confirmation modal.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to focus on improving the modularity and component structure of my app to make it more reusable and maintainable. This includes breaking down larger components into smaller, more focused ones that can be easily reused across different parts of the application. I aim to create more generic UI components, such as buttons, input fields, and modals, that can be shared across multiple pages or sections of the app. Additionally, I plan to explore custom hooks for extracting reusable logic, and better manage state between components using tools like the Context API or Redux. This approach will make my codebase cleaner, more scalable, and easier to update in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - A fantastic resource for styling.
- [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) - Helpful for mastering React hooks and state management.
